- Display: [7 inch touch display](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/lcd-oled/7ep-caplcd.htm?___SID=U)
- Battery: 6 hours on a single charge

### Ports

- 2 USB 3.0 ports
- 2 full-sized HDMI 2.0 ports
- 3.5mm audio jack
- Gigabit Ethernet port
- USB-C power port
- microSD card slot
- GPIO pins

### Software

- KiCad for PCB design
- DaVinci Resolve for video editing

#### Topic

Channel introduction and project introduction for Project-Chaos

#### Introduction

<!-- First, I will describe my idea and explain the origin of the project's name. Then, I will outline the specifications. -->

<!-- My channel name is ERR0RW0LF, and I will refer to myself by this name. This will be the first video on my channel. -->

Hello, I am ERR0RW0LF and welcome to my channel. I'm from Germany, so please excuse me if I mispronounce something. I like to program and have a bit of knowledge about hacking. Today, I am going to introduce you to my new project, Project-Chaos. This will be a small, portable mini-computer. The name is inspired by Greek mythology. This device will serve as a starting point for many other projects. I am going to develop this project in a series of videos. I'm new to making videos, so I hope my quality will improve. If you want to follow along and see me hopefully improve, I would be happy if you subscribe. Now, let's get started.

#### Chapter 1: Idea

I had this idea for a while now. I wanted to create a small, portable computer that I could use for various applications. I am a big fan of Raspberry Pi and I have used it in some of my personal projects. So when I saw that Raspberry Pi had released the new Computing Module 5, I knew that this was the perfect board for my project.

My main priority was to make this device portable and versatile. I wanted to be able to use it for different purposes like programming, gaming, hacking, etc. I also wanted to make it expandable so that I could add more features to it in the future.

For my requirements, I chose the Raspberry Pi CM5 with 8GB of RAM and no eMMC. This is the lite version of the board. It boots from an SD card unlike the eMMC version. I also chose the 7-inch touch display from Waveshare. This display is perfect for my project as it isn't too big and it has a good resolution.

#### Chapter 2: Specs

Now let's talk about the specs of the device. As I mentioned earlier, the board I am using is the Raspberry Pi CM5 with 8GB of RAM. This board has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth which is great for my project. The display I am using is a 7-inch touch display from Waveshare. This display has a resolution of 1280Ã—800 which is perfect for my project.

Then there are the ports. I plan to use the same ports as the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 IO board which includes:

I also plan to run this device on a battery with a capacity of 5000mAh. The battery should last for at least 6 hours on a single charge.

- 2 full-sized HDMI 2.0 ports
- 3.5mm audio jack
- Gigabit Ethernet port
- USB-C power port
- microSD card slot
- GPIO pins

I plan to run different Linux distributions on this device, starting with Raspberry Pi OS. I may switch to Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Mint, Kali Linux, or another distribution later.

I am considering whether to add a physical keyboard to the device or use a virtual keyboard on the display.

#### Chapter 3: Software

I plan on using KiCad to design the PCB for this project.

I want to be able to run different Linux distributions on this device. I will start with Raspberry Pi OS but I might switch to something else later. Maybe I will switch to Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Mint, Kali Linux, or something else. I will decide that later. It should be easy to switch between different OSes because I will use the Lite version of the CM5 board.

#### Chapter 4: Conclusion

That's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it. In the next video, I will start designing the PCB for this project. Let me know in the comments if you prefer to see the whole process or just the final result. If you have any suggestions for this project, feel free to leave them in the comments. See you in the next one. Goodbye and remember, stay curious and keep coding!

<!-- I will probably use a glitch effect for the outro. -->
